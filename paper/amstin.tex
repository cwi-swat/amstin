\section{Requirements for a programming language}

The programming model is based on cyclic graphs.
Graphs are kept distinct from each other. That is,
each graph is considered a self-contained
artifact, without links or pointers to other graphs.

A natural way to create such graphs is with 
imperative effects.

This potentially requires more copying of data
than would be the case in tree-based representations.

To modify graphs, place-holder objects are useful,
as is the ability to "become" another object.

\subsection{Simple reflection}

Fields can be created dynamically and accessed with
"." notation or reflective access.

\begin{verbatim}
o.foo   == o.get("foo")
\end{verbatim}

Assignment to fields can be overriden
\begin{verbatim}
   o.bar = 3   ==> o.set("bar", 3)
\end{verbatim}
